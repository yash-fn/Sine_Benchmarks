Maybe some sort of automatic file logger to save output of each run. optional toggle so not running while debugging. 
some sort of debug vs production build so that unnecceary output is muted (only need averages)
actual other functions to implement sine and such routines broken into multiple source files. i.e. break main.cpp into smaller files
functions to benchmark sine functions with regard to error.

Summary:
Organization into smaller source files
Error benchmarking functions
Optional file output and muted runtime output
new sin implementations
graphing capabilities for error benchmarking and potentially also speed benchmarks. maybe use R; create report
